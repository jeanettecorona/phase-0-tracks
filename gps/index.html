<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags are to give meaning to the text. For example, if someone with a disability needs to the text from a website read aloud, semantic tags allow for text to be separated and the content to be defined in sections rather than having to listen to the entire text. The most useful semantic tags I've seen are the section, article, and nav.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The order the browser uses to display elements are: HTML, Content Sink, Style Sheets, CSS Style Rules, Frame Tree, and Painting, and Display. Parsing the HTML code constructs the DOM tree, then the rendering engine constructs the tree. Once the layout of the tree is built, it is painted and then the elements are displayed. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Snippets! Yes, I can see myself using snippets if it's a template that I'll be needing repeatedly. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? 
The most difficult concept in this challenge was saving the snippet. We didn't know we had to save the snippet file under the user folder.

How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Getting snippet to work. Understanding which tags should immediately follow or be nested within new tags that I'm learning. I find MDN to be very helpful. Visual examples on the page are what I look for.
