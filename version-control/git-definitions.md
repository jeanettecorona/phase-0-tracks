# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control keeps track of every modification in code and saves different versions of a project. It is useful because allows you to merge revisions made by different people, backtrack or undo changes, if necessary and it also protects the source code. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a copy of the project you're working on. You can work on a branch separately and write new code (features) for a project before merging it back into the original project. Branches can also be discard a feature or branch if one doesn't like the result.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a save point for the project and you can go back to this point later if needed. A good commit message is detailed and states the changes made since the last commit. 

* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict happens when two branches are modified and there are conflicting changes. 

* THE END! :)
